# Boxing-java-web-game
A text-based boxing simulation game currently in development. Phase one and two will use local files 
and a simple GUI for input/output.

The first development phase will complete the creation of boxers and the core fight engine reading
and writing to the local file system.

Phase two will add MySQL database functionality, and expand on the boxer classes and fight engine.

Phase three will develop a web interface.
