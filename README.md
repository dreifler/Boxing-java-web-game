# Boxing-java-web-game
A project undertaken to learn Spring/MySQL/Maven web app back end development. This builds the backend of a java web app using Maven, MySQL, Spring and Spring Security. It has login, user authentication/access restrictions, and a database of fighters that can be updated from the web interface. 

The initial version of the game runs on the console and is currently found in Boxing-java-web-game/src/boxingsim/ of the Master branch. 

The backend was built to connect MySQL database to a web interface using Spring to transform the initial console version into a Java Spring App. 

The Spring-Hibernate branch incorporated Hibernate to add a MySQL database functionality to the app.

The current in work branch is the Maven-Security branch which adds login, user roles and Maven support to the Web App. This is currently being merged with the initial console game to complete the prototype of the full web application.
